# To the moon

This simple application is based on a program created by Coinbase to promote
the launch of their brokerage platform. It counts down to a lunar landing
based on the UNIX time placed into the landing_time variable located in
the script tag at the bottom of index.html. The stars move at varying speeds
depending on how close to zero the countdown is.

I've included various console.log statements you can use to calculate what
time you would like to countdown from. When the time reaches zero, the rocket
lands on the moon and a button appears that links to wherever. To include
a musical track, create a folder called /music and change the path inside
the audio tag in index.html. The music will autoplay onload, except on mobile devices.

## Note

This application works in Chrome, Brave, and Firefox. If another browser is used,
the user is directed to change browsers. Be sure to check that any adblockers you have installed are not blocking some of the javascript.
